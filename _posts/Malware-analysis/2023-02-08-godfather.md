# Introduction

`Godfather` is a malware that targets Android devices. It was first discovered in `2020` and is known for its sophisticated and aggressive behavior. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information such as banking credentials, passwords, and other personal data from infected devices.

The `Godfather` Android banking malware is a threat to users in 16 countries, as it has been designed to steal account credentials from over 400 online banking sites and cryptocurrency exchanges. It accomplishes this by disguising itself as a login screen, overlaying the login forums of banking and cryptocurrency exchange apps.



# Anti-emulator 

After installing The malware on the device, it checks the device if it's an **emulator** or not. If the malware is installed on the emulator, the malware **will not** run its malicious functions.

<br>

The method retrun is `boolean`. When the malware checks for the emulator exitance, the return is **0** when there's no emulator or the return is **1** when there's an emulator



# Collect vectim's device info

The malware will collect information about the device that's infected and send the collected information to the **C2 server**. The information which will be sent to the C2 server such as `applist` which will collect all the applications installed on the device, `ag` to get the user agent, `sim` to get the network operator name, `phone` to get the phone number of the device, `model`, and `ver` of the device.

# USSD 

This method can make the malware transfers meoney using money transfers by making `USSD` (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data) calls without even using the dialer user interface.

</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(3): The method that performs USSD<u></u> </font></center>
<br>

When the malware communicate withe C2 server and the response from the C2 server contains `startUSSD` command, the malware will start this method to transfer money using `USSD`.

# Call forwarding

The malware has the ability to forward incomming calls. This is used to bypass the two factor authintication `2FA`.

# Push notifications

The malware will push fake notifications as if the notification came from ligitmate application. When the user opens the fake notifications, this opens a fake Web page and the user may enter his/her inforamtions such as username, email, or password.

<br>


# Smishing

The malware will send message which contains malicous URLs to download malicous applications to victim's contacts. This message is received from the C2 server and then the malware will send it to all contacts.

<p align="center">

<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(10): The command that performs Smishing<u></u> </font></center>
<br>


# Steal SMSs

The malware will collect the SMSs on the victim's device and send the data to the C2 server. This is used to bypass the two factor authintication `2FA`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/godfather/11.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(11): The method that performs collecting SMSs<u></u> </font></center>
<br>

When the malware communicate withe C2 server and the response from the C2 server contains `sentSMS` command, the malware will start this method to start sending the SMSs to the C2 server.

</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(12): The command that performs stealing SMSs<u></u> </font></center>
<br>


# Record the screen

The malware will record a video of the screen of the victim's device then sends the video to the C2 server. This technique is used to steal sensitive data as the same as overlay attack. When the user opens a targeted app, the malware send to the C2 server that the user opened a targeted app. The C2 server sends a command to start recording the screen.

<br>


# VNC

`VNC`, which stands for Virtual Network Computing, is a protocol for remote control of computers. VNC can be used by the malware to gain remote control over an infected device, allowing the attacker to perform various malicious activities.

For example, a VNC-based Android malware might allow an attacker to remotely access the device's screen, camera, microphone, and other resources, allowing them to steal sensitive information, carry out phishing attacks, or monitor the user's activities. The malware may also use the VNC connection to install additional malicious software on the device, making it part of a larger network of compromised devices (known as a botnet).

</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(14): The command that performs starting VNC<u></u> </font></center>
<br>

settings_port: The value of the port is `5900`.

settings_password: the value of the password is `123`. 

user: the value of the user is `bluetooth_name`.

vnc_host: the value of the host is `5500`.

The `settings_port`, `settings_password` values are saved in the  Shared Preferences.

# Overlay attack

When the user opens a targeted app, the malware displays a fake or malicious overlay on top of the active window of the targeted app. The opened malicious window is the same as the legitimate app. This allows the attacker to steal sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other sensitive data, by tricking the user into entering it into the overlay.

# Start/Kill the malware

The C2 server sends to the malware to start or terminate itself.

<br>

# Cache cleaner

The malware will clean the cache of an app. The malware will send `cachecleaner` command from the C2 server and app name in the command.

<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(18): The command that clear the cache<u></u> </font></center>
<br>


# Communications

The malware will get the C2 server URL from description of a Telegram channel. The malware will send an `HTTP` reguest To `https://t.me/varezotukomirza` to get the encrypted C2 server `zH7cPW3ZEHj5SDEKxFtXcoMXMJmMGlMGCH978whkdfQ`. The C2 server is encrypted using `Blowfish` algorithm  with `ECB_MODE` and  `ABC` as a key and encoded using `Base64`.


<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/godfather/18.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u>(19): The encrypted C2 server<u></u> </font></center>
<br>

When we decrypt The C2 server:

 - Decoded the `Base64`, then

 - Decrypt the `blowfish` with `ECB_MODE` using `ABC` as a key

Thanks to [Witold Precikowski](https://twitter.com/pr3wtd) for helping to decrypt the C2 server. We use this script to decrypt the encrypted C2 server obtained form the Telegram channel.

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import Blowfish
import base64

bs = Blowfish.block_size
key = b'ABC'

data = 'zH7cPW3ZEHj5SDEKxFtXcoMXMJmMGlMGCH978whkdfQ='

# Base64 decode
ciphertext = base64.b64decode(data)

# Decrypt Blowfish in ECB mode
cipher = Blowfish.new(key, Blowfish.MODE_ECB)
msg = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

last_byte = msg[-1]
msg = msg[:- (last_byte if type(last_byte) is int else ord(last_byte))]
print(msg)
```

The decrypted C2 server will be `https://kalopterbomrassa.shop/`.

After the malware gets the C2 server the communication between the C2 server and the malware will be decrypted using `AES/CBC/NoPadding` with `fedcba9876543210` as IV and `0123456789abcdef` as a key.
