# Introduction 

We will start analyzing **Ave Maria** known as WARZONE RAT. Ave Maria is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) which provides some capabilities, such as stealing Cookies  stealing passwords, Keylogging (online and offline), Windows Defender Bypass, and Remote WebCam.

We can take a look at what this threat actor provides to its customers from its site warzone[.]ws.

# Technical summary

When the attaker wants to start a command, it will send to the RAT a hex number. Every hex number has a specific action to be done.

- Password and Cookies Recovery: When it comes to RATs, then it has something with browsers and Email clients. The malware will harvist the cookies, passwords, history, and configurations of browsers. And steal passords and configruations of Email clients.

- Keylogging: Any RAT has the capability to log any keystrokes, but Warzone RAT has the two types of Keylogging which are the live keylogger and the offline keylogger.

- Recording audio: The RAT has the capability to record audio and save it to `.wav` file and send it to the C2 server.

- HRDP: This allows the attacter to connect and control the victim's device without knowing or alerting the victim using Hidden RDP.

- Enumerate processes, disks, and files: The malware can enumerate the currently running processes, disks and their types, and files inside a specific directory.

- File Manager: The RAT gives its customers the ability to download and upload files from the victim's computer, execute a file, and delete files. And compress any directory or folder inside the victim's computer using a command and send it to the C2 server.

- Other features: The malware can terminate any process the attacker wants, uninstall itself by terminating its thread and delete itself from registries, restart the device using commands and create a process to check connectivity, and take screen shots from the victim's device.

# Password and Cookies Recovery

Onece the attacker sends the command to the RAT which will be `0x20` in hex, the malware will create a thread to start Password Recovery action. The RAT will start stealing the saved passwords, configurations, cookies, and history from browsers and extract profiles and passwords from some email services. Then encrypt the data and send it to the C2 server then terminate the thread.

First, the malware will steal the Cookies from Chromium-based browsers such as Google chrome and Microsoft edge by quering `select host_key, path, name, encrypted_value, expires_utc, is_httponly, samesite, is_secure from cookies` from the `cookies` table in `Cookies` database and steal Cookies from Mozilla firefox browser by quering `SELECT host, path, name, value, expiry, isHttpOnly, isSecure FROM moz_cookies` from the `moz_cookies` table.\
The `w_query_get_chrome_based_cookies` (`sub_40C5FA`) function uses `SHGetSpecialFolderPathW` to get the `AppData` path, than append the the `cookies` path `\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network\Cookies` to `Appdata` path `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\`.It will be like this `C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Network\Cookies`

The malware uses the same way to get the all sensitive databases that contain sensitive data such as `Login Data`, `History` of browsers.

<br>

Next, the malware will go after the History of the user's browsers the same as stealing the cookies. For Chromium-based, quering `SELECT url, title, visit_count, last_visit_time FROM urls` and Mozzilla quering `SELECT url, title, visit_count, last_visit_date FROM moz_places`.

<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u> Steal History from browsers - sub_40DC9D <u></u> </font></center>
<br>

In the next figure, the malware will steal the passwords and configurations of specific browsers. By quering `select signon_realm, origin_url, username_value, password_value from logins` from `logins` table of `Login Data` db.

<br>

For Email serivices, the malware will go after outlook (`sub_4104A0`), Foxmail (`sub_410981`), Thunderbird (`sub_40FA23`) Email clients.\
As we can see in the next figure, the malware will steal the configurations and login data from Thunderbird email client.

<br>

After stealing the sensitive data from browsers and Email clients, the malware will encrypt the stolen data using **customized RC4** encryption algorithm then send it to the C2 server. The malware uses `nevergonnagiveyouup` as encryption key to customized RC4 algorithm. After encryption, the malware will `send` it using sockets.

# Keylogging

The RAT has the two types of keylogging which are the live keylogger and the offline keylogger. The offline keylogger is run when the victim is offline.\
When the attaker sends the command `0x24` in hex, the RAT will start a thread of Live keylogger function. 
<p align="center">

</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u> Live and offline keylogging - sub_40A78D <u></u> </font></center>
<br>

The malware will create a directory `Microsoft Vision` in the `AppData` directory then create a file with a timestamp-based name. The malware will try to get the Keyboard input messages such as `WM_KEYDOWN` or `WM_KEYUP` which are generated by the OS when the victim interacts with the keyboard by using `GetMessageA` API.

<br>

Inside the `w_mw_get_clipboard_data_keyboard_in` (`sub_40ADCA`) function, we will know that the malware will try to grab the clipboard data inside the `mw_get_clipboard_data ` (`sub_4174BA`). Then encrypte the data and send to the C2 server if it's the live keylogger or write the grabbed data to a file then encrypted it and send to the C2 server if it's offline keylogger.

</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u> How malware grab clipboard data - sub_4174BA <u></u> </font></center>
<br>

After grabbing the clipboard data, the malware will start keylogging by getting the windows name and check the keyboad input state using `w_GetKeyboardState` (`sub_40AAFD`) function and check if is `Shift` or `Caps Lock` pushed. And if `Shift` or `Caps Lock` were pushed, the `w_ToLowerCase` (`sub_401098`) function will convert the uppercase to lowercase.\
Then encrypte the logs and send to the C2 server if it's the live keylogger or write the grabbed logs to a file then encrypted it and send to the C2 server if it's offline keylogger.\
The logs are `#Window Name: `, is `Shift` or `Caps Lock` pushed, keystrokes.

<br>

When the malware receives the command `0x26` in hex, the malware terminate the thread which runs the keylogging function.

<br>


# Recording Audio

The RAT has two functions for recording audio `mw_record_audio` (`sub_40B46F`) and `mw_record_audio_0` (`sub_040BB1C`). The command is `0x54` in hex to start one function in a thread.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/MA/warzonerat/15.png" />
</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u> Two recording function - sub_40528D <u></u> </font></center>
<br>

Inside The first function `mw_record_audio` (`sub_40B46F`), we see that `waveInOpen` API Opens the audio input device for recording with the configuration parameters from the `pwfx` structure. And save the record in a time-based `.wav` file. And even it can prepare for a new recording audio. This function only records audio and save the `.wav` file.

</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u> mw_record_audio function - sub_40B46F <u></u> </font></center>
<br>

And inside the second function `mw_record_audio_0` (`sub_040BB1C`), it does what this `mw_record_audio` function is doing. But after recording audio and save the `.wav` file, it encrypt and send it to the C2 server before starting a new record.

</p>
<center><font size="3"> <u>Figure</u> Sending the audio file to the C2 server - sub_040BB1C<u></u> </font></center>
<br>

`waveInUnprepareHeader` function is called after the audio was recorded and captured in the buffer which is a cleanup process.\
To terminate recording audio, the RAT get the command `0x5A` in hex.
